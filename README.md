# Secure File Sharing System

## Project Overview
This project implements a secure file sharing system that allows users to upload and download files safely. Files are encrypted using **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** before storage and decrypted upon retrieval. The system also includes basic key management to handle encryption keys securely.

---

## Features
- Secure file upload & download portal using **Flask**
- **AES-256 encryption** for files at rest and in transit
- Simple and user-friendly **web interface**
- Secure handling of encryption keys
- File integrity validation
- Documented architecture and security measures

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python Flask** – Backend
- **PyCryptodome** – AES encryption
- **HTML + Bootstrap** – Frontend
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control
- **Postman / curl** – Testing
